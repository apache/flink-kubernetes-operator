# Flink Operator Roadmap

This page is intended to present an overview of the general direction of the Flink Kubernetes Operator project, and the larger new features on our radar.
It's not a comprehensive list and might be slightly outdated at any given time. Please check JIRA for the actual work items and the Flink mailing lists for feature planning and discussion.

## What’s Next?

- Improved rollback mechanism and stability conditions
- Autoscaler hardening and improvements
- Support for in-place job rescaling with Flink 1.18
