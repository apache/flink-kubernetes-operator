# Quick Start

This document provides a quick introduction to using the Flink Kubernetes Operator. Readers
of this document will be able to deploy the Flink operator itself and an example Flink job to a local
Kubernetes installation.

## Prerequisites

We assume that you have a local installations of the following:
1. [docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
2. [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
3. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)

So that the `kubectl` and `helm` commands are available on your local system.

For docker we recommend that you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed
and configured with at least 8GB of RAM.
For kubernetes [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is our choice, at the time of writing this we are
using version v1.21.5. You can start a cluster with the following command:

```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.21.5
üòÑ minikube v1.25.1 on Darwin 12.1
üÜï Kubernetes 1.23.1 is now available. If you would like to upgrade, specify: --kubernetes-version=v1.23.1
‚ú® Using the docker driver based on existing profile
üëç Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
üöú Pulling base image ...
üèÉ Updating the running docker "minikube" container ...
üê≥ Preparing Kubernetes v1.21.5 on Docker 20.10.12 ...
‚ñ™ kubelet.housekeeping-interval=5m
üîé Verifying Kubernetes components...
‚ñ™ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5 (http://gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5)
üåü Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
üèÑ Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

We also recommend [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) as GUI for kubernetes, but it is optional for this quickstart guide.

## Deploying the operator

Install the certificate manager on your Kubernetes cluster to enable adding the webhook component (only needed once per Kubernetes cluster):
```bash
kubectl create -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.8.2/cert-manager.yaml
```

{{< hint info >}}
In case the cert manager installation failed for any reason you can disable the webhook by passing `--set webhook.create=false` to the helm install command for the operator.
{{< /hint >}}

Now you can deploy the selected stable Flink Kubernetes Operator version using the included Helm chart:

```bash
helm repo add flink-operator-repo https://downloads.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-{{< stable >}}{{< version >}}{{< /stable >}}{{< unstable >}}&lt;OPERATOR-VERSION&gt;{{< /unstable >}}/
helm install flink-kubernetes-operator flink-operator-repo/flink-kubernetes-operator
```

To find the list of stable versions please visit https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html

{{< hint info >}}
The Helm chart by default points to the `ghcr.io/apache/flink-kubernetes-operator` image repository.
If you have connectivity issues or prefer to use Dockerhub instead you can use `--set image.repository=apache/flink-kubernetes-operator` during installation.
{{< /hint >}}

You may verify your installation via `kubectl` and `helm`:
```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
flink-kubernetes-operator-fb5d46f94-ghd8b 2/2 Running 0 4m21s

helm list
NAME NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED STATUS CHART APP VERSION
flink-kubernetes-operator default 1 2022-03-09 17 (tel:12022030917):39:55.461359 +0100 CET deployed flink-kubernetes-operator-{{< version >}} {{< version >}}
```

## Submitting a Flink job

Once the operator is running as seen in the previous step you are ready to submit a Flink job:
```bash
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/flink-kubernetes-operator/{{< stable_branch >}}/examples/basic.yaml
```
You may follow the logs of your job, after a successful startup (which can take on the order of a minute in a fresh environment, seconds afterwards) you can:

```bash
kubectl logs -f deploy/basic-example

2022-03-11 21:46:04,458 INFO  org.apache.flink.runtime.checkpoint.CheckpointCoordinator    [] - Triggering checkpoint 206 (type=CHECKPOINT) @ 1647035164458 for job a12c04ac7f5d8418d8ab27931bf517b7.

2022-03-11 21:46:06,458 INFO  org.apache.flink.runtime.checkpoint.CheckpointCoordinator    [] - Triggering checkpoint 207 (type=CHECKPOINT) @ 1647035166458 for job a12c04ac7f5d8418d8ab27931bf517b7.
2022-03-11 21:46:06,483 INFO  org.apache.flink.runtime.checkpoint.CheckpointCoordinator    [] - Completed checkpoint 207 for job a12c04ac7f5d8418d8ab27931bf517b7 (28725 bytes, checkpointDuration=25 ms, finalizationTime=0 ms).
```

To expose the Flink Dashboard you may add a port-forward rule or look the [ingress configuration options]({{< ref "docs/operations/ingress" >}}):

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/basic-example-rest 8081
```

Now the Flink Dashboard is accessible at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/).

In order to stop your job and delete your FlinkDeployment you can:

```bash
kubectl delete flinkdeployment/basic-example
```
