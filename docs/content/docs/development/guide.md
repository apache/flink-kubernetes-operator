# Development Guide

We gathered a set of best practices here to aid development.

## Local environment setup

We recommend you install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
and [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) on your local machine. For the setup please refer to our
[quickstart]({{< ref "docs/try-flink-kubernetes-operator/quick-start" >}}#prerequisites).

### Building docker images
You can build your own flavor of image as follows via specifying your `<repo>`:
```bash
docker build . -t <repo>/flink-kubernetes-operator:latest
docker push <repo>/flink-kubernetes-operator:latest
```

If you are using minikube you might want to load the image directly instead of pushing it to a registry:

```bash
minikube image load <repo>/flink-kubernetes-operator:latest
```

You can cut a corner via using the docker daemon of your minikube installation directly as follows:
```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -t <repo>/flink-kubernetes-operator:latest
```

When you want to reset your environment to the defaults you can do the following:
```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env --unset)
```

The most useful insight when it comes to minikube that it is just a docker container on your local machine and you can
ssh to it with the following command in case you needed to hack something there (like adding a hostpath mount or modifying docker images).

```bash
minikube ssh
Last login: Wed Mar 9 10:01:21 2022 from 192.168.49.1
docker@minikube:~$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                             TAG                IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
flink-kubernetes-operator                              latest             cf7856d9ef59   23 hours ago    578MB
docker@minikube:~$ exit
```

### Installing the operator locally

```bash
helm install flink-kubernetes-operator helm/flink-kubernetes-operator --set image.repository=<repo>/flink-kubernetes-operator --set image.tag=latest
```

To uninstall you can simply call:

```bash
helm uninstall flink-kubernetes-operator
```

### Running the operator from the IDE

You can run or debug the `FlinkOperator` from your preferred IDE. The operator itself is accessing the deployed Flink clusters through the REST interface. When running locally the `rest.port`, `rest.address` and `kubernetes.rest-service.exposed.type` Flink configuration parameters must be modified.

When using `minikube tunnel` the rest service is exposed on `localhost:8081`
```bash
> minikube tunnel

> kubectl get services
NAME                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
basic-session-example        ClusterIP      None           <none>        6123/TCP,6124/TCP   14h
basic-session-example-rest   LoadBalancer   10.96.36.250   127.0.0.1     8081:30572/TCP      14h
```
The operator picks up the default log and flink configurations from `/opt/flink/conf`. You can put the rest configuration parameters here:
```bash
cat /opt/flink/conf/flink-conf.yaml
rest.port: 8081
rest.address: localhost
kubernetes.rest-service.exposed.type: LoadBalancer
```

Due to fabric8 conflicts between core Flink and the operator, the `flink-kubernetes-operator` module depends on the shaded `flink-kubernetes-standalone` jar which contains the relocated version of the old fabric8 Kubernetes client. Unfortunately IntelliJ is not great at handling dependencies with classifiers so you might get the following error when trying to run `FlinkOperator#main`:

```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'java.lang.Object io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.dsl.ServiceResource.fromServer()'
```

There are two solutions to this problem, both requires you to first build the project.

First:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Then either:

 1. Import the `flink-kubernetes-operator` submodule as a separate IntelliJ project. This will resolve the classifier dependency correctly from your local maven cache.
 2. If you want to keep a single multi-module project, you need to add the `flink-kubernetes-standalone-XX-shaded.jar` on the classpath manually when running the main method:
 `Edit Run Configuration/Modify Options/Modify Classpath`

### Generating and Upgrading the CRD

By default, the CRD is generated by the [Fabric8 CRDGenerator](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/master/doc/CRD-generator.md), when building from source.
When installing flink-kubernetes-operator for the first time, the CRD will be applied to the kubernetes cluster automatically. But it will not be removed or upgraded when re-installing the flink-kubernetes-operator, as described in the relevant helm [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/).
So if the CRD is changed, you have to delete the CRD resource manually, and re-install the flink-kubernetes-operator.

```bash
kubectl delete crd flinkdeployments.flink.apache.org
```

### Mounts

The operator supports to specify the volume mounts. The default mounts to hostPath can be activated by the following command. You can change the default mounts in the `helm/flink-kubernetes-operator/values.yaml`

```bash
helm install flink-operator helm/flink-operator --set operatorVolumeMounts.create=true --set operatorVolumes.create=true
```


## CI/CD

We use [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions) to help you automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues.
You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow.
Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

Considering the cost of running the builds, the stability, and the maintainability, flink-kubernetes-operator chose GitHub Actions and build the whole CI/CD solution on it.
All the unit tests, integration tests, and the end-to-end tests will be triggered for each PR.

Note: Please make sure the CI passed before merging.
