# Accessing Flinkâ€™s Web UI

The Flink Kubernetes Operator, by default, does not change the way the native kubernetes integration [exposes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/resource-providers/native_kubernetes/#accessing-flinks-web-ui) the Flink Web UI.

# Ingress
The Operator also supports creating an optional [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) entry for Web UI access. Ingress generation can be turned on by setting the `ingressDomain` field in the FlinkDeployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: flink.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: FlinkDeployment
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: basic-ingress
spec:
  image: flink:1.14.3
  flinkVersion: v1_14
  ingressDomain: flink.k8s.io
  ...
```

The Operator takes the `name`, `namespace` and `ingressDomain` values from the CR and creates an Ingress entry using the template `{{name}}.{{namespace}}.{{ingressDomain}}` as the host. This requires that anything `*.flink.k8s.io` should be routed to the Ingress Controller on the Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
kubectl get ingress
NAME             CLASS   HOSTS                                 ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
basic-ingress    nginx   basic-ingress.default.flink.k8s.io    192.168.49.2   80      30m
basic-ingress2   nginx   basic-ingress2.default.flink.k8s.io   192.168.49.2   80      3m39s
```

The examples above were created on a minikube cluster. Check the [description](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/) for easily enabling the NGINX Ingress Controller on minikube.
