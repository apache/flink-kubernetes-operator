# Role-based Access Control Model

To be able to deploy the operator itself and Flink jobs, we define two separate Kubernetes
[roles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole).
The former, called `flink-operator` role is used to manage the `flinkdeployments`, to create and manage the
[JobManager](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/#jobmanager) deployment
for each Flink job and other resources like [services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
The latter, called the `flink` role is used by the JobManagers of the jobs to create and manage the
[TaskManagers](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/#taskmanagers) and
[ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) for the job.

These service accounts and roles can be created via the operator Helm [chart]({{< ref "docs/operations/helm" >}}).
By default the `flink-operator` role is cluster scoped (created as a `clusterrole`) and thus allowing a single operator
instance to be responsible for all Flink deployments (jobs) in a Kubernetes cluster regardless of the namespace they are
deployed to (with the additional [instruction](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-release-0.1/docs/operations/rbac/#cluster-scoped-flink-operator-with-jobs-running-in-other-namespaces) below). Certain environments are more restrictive and only allow namespaced roles, so we also support this option
via [watchNamespaces]({{< ref "docs/operations/helm" >}}#watching-only-specific-namespaces).

The `flink` role is always namespaced, by default it is created in the namespace of the operator. When
[watchNamespaces]({{< ref "docs/operations/helm" >}}#watching-only-specific-namespaces) is enabled it is created for all
watched namespaces individually.

## Cluster Scoped Flink Operator With Jobs Running in Other Namespaces
The steps described in the [quick-start](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-release-0.1/docs/try-flink-kubernetes-operator/quick-start/#deploying-the-operator) let users install Flink operator and run Flink jobs in the default namespace. To run Flink jobs in another namespace, users are responsible for creating a flink service account in that namespace. This is when users deploy cluster scoped Flink operator without using the `--set watchNamespaces={namespaces}` option and wish to create Flink jobs in other namespaces later.

For each additional namespace that runs the Flink jobs, users need to do the following:
1. Switch to the namespace by running:
    ```sh
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=CHANGEIT
    ```
2. Create the service account, role, and role binding in the namespace using the commands below:
    ``` sh
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: flink-kubernetes-operator
        app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.1
      name: flink
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: flink-kubernetes-operator
        app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.1
      name: flink
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - ""
      resources:
      - pods
      - configmaps
      verbs:
      - '*'
    - apiGroups:
      - apps
      resources:
      - deployments
      verbs:
      - '*'
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: flink-kubernetes-operator
        app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.1
      name: flink-role-binding
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Role
      name: flink
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: flink
    EOF
    ```
3. Optionally create an example Flink job in the namespace. Run the command from the root of the cloned flink-kuberntes-operator repo:
    ```sh
    kubectl -f example/basic.yaml
    ```
