# Custom Flink Resource Listeners

The Flink Kubernetes Operator allows users to listen to events and status updates triggered for the Flink Resources managed by the operator.
This feature enables tighter integration with the user's own data platform.

By implementing the `FlinkResourceListener` interface users can listen to both events and status updates per resource type (`FlinkDeployment` / `FlinkSessionJob`). These methods will be called after the respective events have been triggered by the system.
Using the context provided on each listener method users can also get access to the related Flink resource and the `KubernetesClient` itself in order to trigger any further events etc on demand.

Similar to [custom validator implementations]({{< ref "docs/operations/validator" >}}) resource listeners are loaded via the Flink [Plugins](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/filesystems/plugins) mechanism.

In order to enable your custom `FlinkResourceListener` you need to:

 1. Implement the interface
 2. Add your listener class to `org.apache.flink.kubernetes.operator.listener.FlinkResourceListener` in `META-INF/services`
 3. Package your JAR and add it to the plugins directory of your operator image (`/opt/flink/plugins`)
