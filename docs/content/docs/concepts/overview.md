# Overview
Flink Kubernetes Operator acts as a control plane to manage the complete deployment lifecycle of Apache Flink applications. Although Flinkâ€™s native Kubernetes integration already allows you to directly deploy Flink applications on a running Kubernetes(k8s) cluster, [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) and the [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) have also become central to a Kubernetes native deployment experience.

Flink Kubernetes Operator aims to capture the responsibilities of a human operator who is managing Flink deployments. Human operators have deep knowledge of how Flink deployments ought to behave, how to start clusters, how to deploy jobs, how to upgrade them and how to react if there are problems. The main goal of the operator is the automation of these activities, which cannot be achieved through the Flink native integration alone.

# Known issues & limitations

JobResultStore Resource Leak

To mitigate the impact of [FLINK-27569](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-27569) the operator introduced a workaround [FLINK-27573](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-27573) by setting `job-result-store.delete-on-commit=false` and a unique value for `job-result-store.storage-path` for every cluster launch. The storage path for older runs must be cleaned up manually, keeping the latest directory always:

```shell
ls -lth /tmp/flink/ha/job-result-store/basic-checkpoint-ha-example/
total 0
