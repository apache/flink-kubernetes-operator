# Documentation generators

This module contains generators that create HTML files directly from Flink Kubernetes Operator's source code.

## Configuration documentation

The `ConfigOptionsDocGenerator` can be used to generate a reference of `ConfigOptions`. By default, a separate file is generated for each `*Options` class found in `org.apache.flink.kubernetes.operator.docs.configuration`. The `@ConfigGroups` annotation can be used to generate multiple files from a single class.

To integrate an `*Options` class from another package, add another module-package argument pair to `ConfigOptionsDocGenerator#LOCATIONS`.

The files can be generated by running `mvn package -Pgenerate-docs -pl flink-kubernetes-docs -am -nsu -DskipTests`, and can be integrated into the documentation using `{{ include generated/<file-name> >}}`.

The documentation must be regenerated whenever
* an `*Options` class was added or removed
* a `ConfigOption` was added to or removed from an `*Options` class
* a `ConfigOption` was modified in any way.
