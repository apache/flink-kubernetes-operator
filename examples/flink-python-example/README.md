# Flink Kubernetes Operator Python Example

## Overview

This is an end-to-end example of running Flink Python jobs using the Flink Kubernetes Operator.


*What's in this example?*

 1. Python script of a simple streaming job
 2. DockerFile to build custom image with pyflink and python demo
 3. Example YAML for submitting the python job using the operator

## How does it work?

Flink supports Python jobs in application mode by utilizing `org.apache.flink.client.python.PythonDriver` class as the 
entry class. With the Flink Kubernetes Operator, we can reuse this class to run Python jobs as well. 

The class is packaged in flink-python_${scala_version}-${flink_version}.jar which is in the default Flink image.
So we do not need to create a new job jar. Instead, we just set `entryClass` of the job crd to 
`org.apache.flink.client.python.PythonDriver`. After applying the job yaml, the launched job manager pod will run the `main()` 
method of PythonDriver and parse arguments declared in the `args` field of the job crd.

Note, in `args` field, users must either specify `-py` option or `-pym` option. 
Besides, order of elements in `args` field matters: due to current parsing process, Flink specific options(e.g -pyfs, -py) must be placed at first and 
user-defined arguments should be placed in the end. Check the [doc](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/docs/deployment/cli/#submitting-pyflink-jobs) for more details about PyFlink arguments.

A working example would be:
```yaml
args: ["-pyfs", "/opt/flink/usrlib/pythonjob/python_demo.py", "-pyclientexec", "/usr/local/bin/python3", "-py", "/opt/flink/usrlib/pythonjob/python_demo.py", "-myarg", "123"]
```
But the following will throw exception:
```yaml
args: ["-myarg", "123", "-pyfs", "/opt/flink/usrlib/pythonjob/python_demo.py", "-pyclientexec", "/usr/local/bin/python3", "-py", "/opt/flink/usrlib/pythonjob/python_demo.py"]
```

## Usage

The following steps assume that you have the Flink Kubernetes Operator installed and running in your environment.


**Step 1**: Put your Python script files under the `flink-python-example` directory and add your Python script into the 
Dockerfile

**Step 2**: Build docker image

Check this [doc](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/docker/#using-flink-python-on-docker) for more details about building Pyflink image. Note, Pyflink 1.15.3 is only supported on x86 arch.  
```bash
# Uncomment when building for local minikube env:
# eval $(minikube docker-env)

DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -t flink-python-example:latest
```
This step will create an image based on an official Flink base image including the Python scripts.

**Step 4**: Create FlinkDeployment Yaml and Submit

Edit the included `python-example.yaml` so that the `job.args` section points to the Python script that you wish to execute, then submit it.

```bash
kubectl apply -f python-example.yaml
```

It is possible to reuse the above image for different Python scripts as long as users make them accessible on Job Manager Pod(e.g using PodTemplate with mounted storage).
